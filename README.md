# Effect-of-Deforestation
An extensive study of deforestation data using SQL was performed, providing ecological patterns and insight. Findings revealed trends, the effect on various income levels was evaluated, and the areas with the highest levels of forest cover were identified.

## Introduction
Using technical database querying techniques, I examined and interpreted large datasets about worldwide deforestation patterns in this significant SQL project that addressed deforestation. 🌍🤻💻I revealed important information on nations, regions, socioeconomic categories, land areas, and forest areas by utilizing SQL. This research supports well-informed decisions for environmental protection and sustainable forestry management.

## Problem Statement:

Despite global awareness of deforestation, comprehensive insights into the intricate dynamics of affected countries, regions, income groups, and environmental factors are lacking. This project aims to address this gap by utilizing advanced SQL techniques to analyze extensive datasets, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable forestry management and effective environmental conservation strategies.

## Skill and Concept Demonstrated:

It demonstrated a range of essential data management skills, such as:
- CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Drop)
- Aggregate Functions
- CTE (Common Table expression)
- Data Scrubbing
-Joins

## Data Modelling:
To model this scenario as a database schema,I defined the three tables: "StudentInformation," "HealthRecord," and "Performance." Each table with a unique 'ID' column, and I used the 'Student_ID' column to establish relationships between the tables. Here's how it would look using SQL to create these tables and set up the relationships:

## Data Cleaning and Visualization

Having established the 'Deforestation_PJT' database, I ensured its selection before proceeding to import the three distinct datasets: "forest_area," "land_area," and "regions." Subsequently, I examined the table layouts and contents, scrutinizing for any NULL values.

### *Modification to the table*
Performing updates on the tables, I conducted a thorough examination for NULL values in the numerical columns of the "forest_area" and "land_area" tables; **316** and **78** rows were affected respectively. Following this assessment, I calculated the average forest and land areas, utilizing these values to substitute for any identified NULL values in the respective columns and rounded the values in the "forest_area_sqkm" and "total_area_sq_mi" columns to two decimal places. To ensure the accuracy of the replacement process, I revisited the columns for verification. This is shown below:

In summary, I demonstrated proficiency in CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) while recognizing the importance of primary keys for data uniqueness and foreign keys for establishing relationships between tables. These crucial skills are vital for effective database management and ensuring data integrity.
